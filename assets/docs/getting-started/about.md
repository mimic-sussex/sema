# About Sema

Sema lets you compose and perform music in real time using simple live coding languages. It also enables you to customise these languages, create new ones, and infuse your live code with bespoke neural networks, using interactive workflows and small training data sets.

Sema is a live coding environment for sound and music similar to SuperCollider, TidalCycles and Gibber. Uniquely, it provides many domain-specific languages and an integrated experience to language design and machine learning in your Web browser. This is achieved through the integration of:

- an interpreter for machine learning libraries (e.g. [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/)) that lets you build and train neural networks
- a compiler for [BNF grammars](https://hardmath123.github.io/earley.html") that enables you to customise or create live coding languages
