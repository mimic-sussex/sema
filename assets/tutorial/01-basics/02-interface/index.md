# Interface 

We are about to go through the top level areas of interaction in Sema.

## Navigation ## 

On the top right, you have a set of links which enable you to navigate within Sema
* **Home** – gives you our warm welcoming ;)

* **Playground** – explore live coding languages and machine learning in free-form ways
* **Tutorial** – this screen

or, to open external resources in a new tab: 
* [**Docs**](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/tree/master/docs) – more in-depth resources such as language and API references and useful code snippets 

* [**Community**](https://forum.toplap.org/c/communities/sema) – the Sema community on TopLap – come and say hi! 

* [**Github**](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema) – where you can find Sema's repository and contribute to its code base

## Dashboard ## 

The dashboard is the main area of interaction in Sema. It arranges widgets in grid layout enables you to view and interact with the information which matters most. 

All widgets share a few common interactions denoted by the following icons:

* **+**  – top-left corner, drags and positions the widget in a grid layout 

* **x**  – top-right corner, removes the widget from the dashboard

* **⨼**  – bottom-right corner, resizes the widget

Go ahead and tweak the current layout to your preferences.

## Commands ## 

In Sema, there are three kinds of commands accessible through buttons.

The global commands are shared between the *Home*, *Playground* and *Tutorial* areas: 

* **Audio** – turn the audio on ([required](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes#webaudio) each time Sema loads) and watch its status 

* **SignOut** – sign out of the current user session

The *Playground* provides specific commands for widget creation and playground reset: 

* **LiveCode Editor**  – add a liveCode editor, optionally selecting a language from the available 

* **Model Editor**  – add a machine learning model editor, optionally selecting a model from the available

* **Debuggers**  – add a widget to debug your code and understand what is happening under-the-hood

* **Audio Analyser**  – add an audio analyser to visualise audio

* **Reset**  – clear the playground to start from scratch

Additionally there are commands dependent on the selected widget 

* **Grammar Editor**  – add a grammar editor to customize and create new languages (dependent on selected liveCode language)

* **Restart**  – restart you ML model training workflow (ML dependent)

The specific interactions with each widget *type* are covered on the following tutorials.
