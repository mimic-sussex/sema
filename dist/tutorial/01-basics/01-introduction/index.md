# Getting Started with Sema!

Welcome to the Sema tutorial! In this tutorial you will learn everything you need to know to start live coding music and audio with machine learning and designing your own live coding language.

You can also consult the [Wiki](https://github.com/mimic-sussex/sema/wiki) for further information. If you're impatient to start hacking Sema free-style, use the *Playground* or explore the source code on [Github](https://github.com/mimic-sussex). The playground can be accessed from links in the navigation bar at the top of this page.

When you have explored this tutorial and want to start to make your music, you will exit this *Tutorial* and do all your work in the *Playground*.

### How to use this tutorial

We recommended that you go from start to finish. You can navigate the Table of Contents via the dropdown menu above (click 'Introduction').

* Part 1, *Basics* starts with the basics of the playground interface, including layouts, the live coding editors and all the available widgets.

* Part 2, *Live Coding with the default language* will get you started with the basic element and syntax of Sema's default language.

* Part 3, *Machine Learning* will show you some machine learning wizardry with custom neural network architectures.

* Part 4 *Language Design* will introduce you to the concepts and workflow to help you get started designing your own custom language.

As you progress through the tutorial, you'll be presented with code and comments designed to illustrate how to use Sema's features.

You can copy and paste code in the editors and tweak it to explore the possibilities.
We recommend that you type it all in manually, the <em>live coding</em> way.

And most importantly, have fun!!!
